# MyMovies

This project has been created using React.
The data provided on this project is fetched from the tvmaze.com API.

This web app allows you to search for movies and tv shows and view ratings, descriptions, genres etc... provided by the API.

The web app also allows you to add shows/movies to your watchlist and it persists via local storage. This is done by storing the ID of the items in your watchlist on local storage and then fetching the data that corresponds to the stored IDs when the watchlist is rendered.
